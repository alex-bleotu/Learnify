# Learnify

Project created by **Bleotu Alexandru** and **Burlacenco È˜tefan**.

### App

The application is designed to create an engaging learning environment for children, fostering healthy competition while they tackle standard subjects. Through this platform, children can learn alongside their friends, making the process not only educational but also fun and interactive. The aim is to make learning a seamless and enjoyable experience, encouraging children to actively participate and excel in their studies.

### Technologies

We used a software called Unity Game Engine to build the app, also we added features like GPT-4 API and Newtonsoft.Json to automatically create and save data. And for the voice system, we used Google Cloud API. This way, the app offers a fun and interactive way for kids to learn with their friends.
